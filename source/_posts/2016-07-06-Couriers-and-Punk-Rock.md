My first job was working with my brother Mark at Print International. I was a courier, and eventually a dispatcher. I was a terrible employee. I was fired and rehired at least 3 times. If I didn't start a family, I probably would've stayed a courier. It paid just enough to buy beer. I got to walk the city all decked out, and I had zero job related stress. Best of all, I could go play drums in my punk band whenever I wanted.

Anyway, Mark forced me to make a shipments database with MS access. I had no idea what I was doing, so it was super painful. I love Mark for forcing my lazy ass to do it anyway. The final output was terrible but it got the job done. I had rows and columns, that's a database right? Who needs sql anyways?
