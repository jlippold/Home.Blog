My love for computers started with my commodore 64 in the early eighties. We were very fortunate to have a computer being from a middle class family. I think back on Arknoid, Kung Fu and Leisure Suit Larry and remember how it taught me to use the command prompt, load a 5 1/4 inch floppy then run an executable. I even remember hacking the high scores in Arknoid. Sure, I only edited a text file in Norton Commander, but it looked like source code to me and I was a baby Kevin Mitnick.

Who would've thought those simple skills would pay off later in life when I was faced with an AS400 and a command prompt.
