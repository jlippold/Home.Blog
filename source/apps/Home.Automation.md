This is a project that I use in my home everyday. It's a node.js mash-up of many API's into one project. It unifies all my devices. Insteon, Harmony, LIFX, Kodi, GeoVision and Ecobee. By bringing these all together, I can trigger complex functions via many interfaces. For example, voice control through Amazon Echo or touch via mobile device ui, or physical insteon keypads. It was also lot's of fun to write, because it allowed me to use ReactJS, web sockets via socketIo and bootstrap 4. Source code is on github
