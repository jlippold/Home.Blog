### About Me


Hello! My name is Jed Lippold and I live Pennsylvania, about an hour outside of New York City. 7 years ago, I was a teacher. I left teaching to start by own business, and now I build awesome educational tools full time. I created, then sold [Skedula.com](http://skedula.com) and [PupilPath.com](http://pupilpath.com), they are the #1 teacher tools in New York! In my spare time, I work on open source projects, play with my 4 daughters, lift weights and play the drums.

I enjoy building and shipping product. I'm a developer who loves to write code. I am a software architect who has designed complicated systems. I have managed a team of 20+ developers. I've done operations to scale products from 0 to 1,000,000 sessions. I've been a product manager, and I've built awesome applications. And most of all, I automate. I automate everything, from teaching in the classroom, to the lights in my home.
