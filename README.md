My personal blog was written with [https://hexo.io/](hexo). I really didn't want to do wordpress, and hexo was pretty easy to use. I wrote a custom theme that can be seen here.

The site uses bootstrap for basic css stuff. Those cool image hovers come from [here](https://miketricking.github.io/dist/). 

I used a bunch of features only supported by newer browsers, and since this is my personal site, I don't have to support IE.

I put it online so others can learn from it. Please don't go stealing my content.
