My personal blog was written with [https://hexo.io/](hexo). I really didn't want to do wordpress, and hexo was pretty easy to use. I wrote a custom theme that can be seen here.

The site uses bootstrap for basic css stuff. Those cool image hovers come from [here](https://miketricking.github.io/dist/) and I used [canvas-video-player](https://github.com/Stanko/html-canvas-video-player) to play background vids on the iphone

I used a bunch of features only supported by newer browsers.
